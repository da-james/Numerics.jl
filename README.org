#+DESCRIPTION: A library of numerical methods coded in Fortran and Python
#+KEYWORDS: python, julia, fortran, math, numerical methods

* Introduction
  This is a numerical package being design in Julia. The package is meant as a
  learning/education tool for myself, and more than likely there are more
  efficient methods in the *LinearAlgebra*, *DifferentialEquations*, or other
  packages.

** Files
   - ~old~ :: Directory of old code to be imported
   - ~src~ :: Directory of code ported to ~Julia~
* Usage
  The code can now be imported via github!
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    # evalutes the code in the file
    using Pkg

    # loads the module for direct use
    Pkg.add("https://github.com/da-james/Numerics.jl")

    # import library
    using Numerics
  #+END_SRC

* Final Notes
  Documentation is slowly being added and most methods are self taught are
  learned through textbooks. References to textbooks are commented into source
  files. Additional methods get added as I continue through my educational
  career.
