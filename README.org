#+DESCRIPTION: A library of numerical methods coded in Julia
#+KEYWORDS: python, julia, fortran, math, numerical methods

* Introduction
  This is a numerical package being designed in Julia. The package is meant as a
  learning/education tool for myself, and more than likely there are more
  efficient/robust methods in *LinearAlgebra*, *DifferentialEquations*, or
  other packages.

** Files
   - ~old~ :: Directory of old code to be imported
   - ~src~ :: Directory of code ported to ~Julia~
* Usage
  The code can now be imported via github!
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    # evalutes the code in the file
    using Pkg

    # loads the module for direct use
    Pkg.add("https://github.com/da-james/Numerics.jl")

    # import library
    using Numerics
  #+END_SRC

* Final Notes
  Documentation is slowly being added and most methods are self taught through
  textbooks. References to textbooks are commented into source files. Additional
  methods get added as I continue through my educational career.
